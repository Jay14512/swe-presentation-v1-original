# Presentation of App Idea

A project concept and technical presentation created during my *Software Engineering for PHP Developers* module.  
Unlike my other repositories, this one focuses entirely on planning, architecture, and communication—not on code.

**Module:** Software Engineering for PHP Developers  
**Goal:** Project Planning & Technical Presentation  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Version:** 1.0  

⚠️ **Note:**  
This repository contains the original concept and presentation for a future project idea.

## 📌 Project Overview

This exercise focused on the early stages of software development: planning, structuring, and communicating an application before writing any code.  
The goal was to design a complete web application idea using PHP and SQL, define the technical requirements, and present the planned architecture.

As part of the assignment, we had to:

- Explain the app concept and its core functionality  
- Describe how users interact with the system  
- Outline the server-side logic, APIs, and database usage  
- Present the planned technical stack  
- Create a detailed **Entity Relationship Model (ERM)**

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to plan a PHP-based web application from scratch  
- Translating feature ideas into technical requirements  
- Communicating architecture to a non-technical and technical audience  
- Understanding the role of ER diagrams in database design  
- Structuring presentations for software engineering concepts  
- Building a solid foundation before beginning development  

This project highlighted the importance of planning and showed how much easier development becomes with a clear architectural roadmap.
