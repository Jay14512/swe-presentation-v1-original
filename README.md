## Presentation of App Idea

**Module:** Software Engineering for PHP Developers  
**Goal:** Project Planning and Technical Presentation  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Description
Unlike other projects that focused on coding, this exercise was designed to teach us the importance of planning and structuring a project before development begins.  
We had to present our idea for a web application built with PHP and SQL, describe its core functionality, and explain the planned technical setup (server, APIs, databases, and user interface).  
Additionally, we had to design a complete Entity Relationship Model (ERM) for the application.

## Main Goal
Understanding and communicating the planning process and technical architecture of a PHP-based web application.
